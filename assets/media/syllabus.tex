\title{Advanced Computational Methods\\
Syllabus}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
This is a very hands-on course which will involve a lot of programming assignments. The
main aims of the course are two fold:\\
\textit{
1. Learning methods, tools and techniques for solving advanced scientific problems.\\
2. Developing practical computational problem solving skills.\\
}
